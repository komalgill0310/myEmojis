# **My Emojis**

# Overview

Welcome to My Emojis! ðŸ˜Š This project is a representation of myself using emojis. The emojis showcase my favorite activities, interests, and games. Additionally, there is an input box where users can add more emojis if they wish to include additional activities. Once a user enters an emoji in the input, they can add it either to the beginning or the end of the existing emojis. Furthermore, users can also delete emojis from either the beginning or the end.
